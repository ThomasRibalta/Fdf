# Goal of Fdf

Fdf(fil de fer) is a project of the 42 school, the aim of this project is to discover Minilibx and the geometry in space.

# Personal opinion

This project is hard because you discover one new lib (Minilibx) and the mathematical calculations isn't common. Without this, the project is very intressing. 

# Result

In coming ...

# Dificulty
